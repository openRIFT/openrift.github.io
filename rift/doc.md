# Repositories

So, you want to create a repository now huh? Well you're in luck because creating file repositories in RIFT is pretty simple, there are 2 ways to do it currently. You can use the in-built editor, or edit a `repo.rift` file manually.

## Built-in edtior

Using the built-in editor is very simple, open up rift, you can either clear out your current `repo.rift` file or you can simply just work off the on you last opened by typing `local` into the URL input. From there you can just type `edit` and it will open up the editor mode. Use `append` to create a new entry, or use `del` to remove an entry at a specific index. All download URL's must be direct file downloads.

### Editor specifc commands

* append: creates a new repository entry
* del: removes an entry at a specific index

## Manually editing

You may choose the manually edit the `repo.rift` file, this way isn't reccomend but is possible. First, you want find where RIFT is installed, then go into the `rift/` folder, there you will find `repo.rift`. You want to open the file and clear it out. After that you can add entries like this: `[LABEL];[URL]`. All download URL's must be direct file downloads.
